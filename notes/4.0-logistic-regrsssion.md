# Logistic Regression

Two types of *Logistic Regression* or *classification*: *Binary* and *Multi Class*. Even though Logic Regression has the word "Regression" in the name, it is used to solve classification problems that are more complex and non-linear in nature. For example, the below data plot shows features that cannot be fit using a linear model.

## Binary Classification

Solves classification problems (two classes). For example, trying to determine if email is spam or not spam.

> $y\in\{0,1\}$

Given them email example $y=0$ could mean no spam where as $y=1$ could mean the email is spam.

How to determine if $y$ is $0$ or $1$? By using a *threshold* classifier such that our hypothesis function $h_\theta(x)$ predicts a value between $0$ and $1$. Such that:

> $0\le h_\theta(x)\le1$

For example:

> If $h_\theta(x)\ge  0.50$; Then predict $y=1$
>
> If $h_\theta(x)\lt  0.50$; Then predict $y=0$

For our hypothesis function to make predictions in this range we will need to use the *Sigmoid* function also called the *Logistic* function.  Recall that our hypothesis function:

> $h_\theta(x)= \theta^tx$

The *Sigmoid* Function ($g$) takes our hypothesis ($z$) as a parameter and returns a value between $0$ and $1$. For example:

> $z = h_\theta(x) \therefore g(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^-z}$

Below shows a plot of the *Sigmoid* function that shows the *threshold* at $0.5$.

**TODO:** Learning algorithm for fitting the learning parameters theta $\theta$.
