# Unrolling Parameters

Unrolling our parameters $\Theta$ from matrices into vectors will be necssary when using more advanced optimization algorithms other than gradient descent. In Python, there are two methods that you can use to flatten a matrix (multi-dimentional array): *flatten()* and *ravel()*
