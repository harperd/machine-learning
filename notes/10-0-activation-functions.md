## Activation Functions

In artificial neural networks, the *activation* function of a node defines the output of that node given an input or set of inputs. A standard computer chip circuit can be seen as a digital network of activation functions that can be "ON" or "OFF", depending on input. The *Sigmoid* function is one of several popular activation functions.
